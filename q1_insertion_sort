Write a function that sorts a doubly linked list of integers in ascending order using the Insertion sort algorithm

Prototype: void insertion_sort_list(listint_t **list);
You are not allowed to modify the integer n of a node. You have to swap the nodes themselves.
Youâ€™re expected to print the list after each time you swap two elements (See example below)
Write in the file 1-O, the big O notations of the time complexity of the Insertion sort algorithm, with 1 notation per line:

in the best case
in the average case
in the worst case

Terminal:
alex@/tmp/sort$ gcc -Wall -Wextra -Werror -pedantic 1-main.c 1-insertion_sort_list.c print_list.c -o insertion
alex@/tmp/sort$ ./insertion
