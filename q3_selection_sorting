Write a function that sorts an array of integers in ascending order using the Quick sort algorithm

Prototype: void quick_sort(int *array, size_t size);
You must implement the Lomuto partition scheme.
The pivot should always be the last element of the partition being sorted.
Youâ€™re expected to print the array after each time you swap two elements (See example below)
Write in the file 3-O, the big O notations of the time complexity of the Quick sort algorithm, with 1 notation per line:

in the best case
in the average case
in the worst case

Terminal:
alex@/tmp/sort$ gcc -Wall -Wextra -Werror -pedantic -std=gnu89 3-main.c 3-quick_sort.c print_array.c -o quick

alex@/tmp/sort$ ./quick
